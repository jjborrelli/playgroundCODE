JavaScript
-----------------

**What is JavaScript (JS) used for?**
  
- make websites respond to user interaction  
- build apps and games  
- access information on the internet  
- organize and present data

**EXAMPLE**  
	```
	confirm('This is an example of using JS to create some interaction on a website. Click OK to continue!')
	```

Makes a box in the browser with OK/Cancel buttons.  

Ask for input with `prompt`  

	```
	prompt('ask a question')
	```

User can then give text based input.  

## Data types  

1. *Numbers* are quantities
2. *Strings* are sequences of characters     
	- requires quotes  
3. *Booleans* are either true or false  

## Console.log  

`console.log()` will take whatever is within the parentheses and log it to the console. This is commonly called **printing out**  

**NOTE** With comparison operators *equal to* is **3** equal signs, `===` and not equal to is `!==`

## If Statements  

An `if` statement is made of the `if` keyword, a condition in parentheses and a pair of curly braces `{}`. If the condition is true then the code in the braces will run.  

	```
	if (condition)
	{
		run.this.code
	}
	else
	{
		run.this.code
	}
	```

Adding an `else` tells what code to run if the condition is false.
